# API Testing

Is it helpful when there are:

- Some items in the shopping cart are promos or informative images.
- Unavailable items for future pre-sale or special offers.
- Complex business rules to restrict the items for some users.
  You can get a random product for your test scenario in each test execution and don't use always the same item.
